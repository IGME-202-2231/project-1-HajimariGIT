### Game Description

"Lanky Loops!" an iconic cereal that rakes in more money then the GDP of the USA! Blordo the Giraffe is America's cereal mascot who gets more recgonition than even Mickey Mouse himself!
As he checked his mailbox one day, he realized his check was only for 10 cents! Jealous of his corprate overlords for stealing all of HIS money, he equips himself with a shotgun and a jetpack gave to him by Mike Tyson on 
One of his holidays and storms off to REEDS Corp to demand a raise! Not budging on giving him a raise, he decides to take things to his own hands, Fly and fight your way outside of their office 
In this 2D Shoot'Em Up to stop them from contiunuing this exploitation!

Defend the Offensive 

- Don't let those greedy workers make it to the office to gain more money off you. If they make it past you it costs one of your hearts.
- You are armed with a shotgun meaning while your bullets will one hit, they will have a short range.
- Your jetpack is a great tool but be careful as not being skillful with it will make you overshoot your eniemies. 
-LOOK OUT FOR THE BOSS, Mr. Smallsington! (if they get passed it's game over)

## You Additions

My health icons will be indictive of if the enemies make it to the office (go past the bottom of the screen). I will be doing my own art for the game and will be using varible movement that will apply momentum (accleration and deceleration) to the player. In addition their exists a "boss" enemy. If this enemy makes it to the office 
you will get a game over instantly.
